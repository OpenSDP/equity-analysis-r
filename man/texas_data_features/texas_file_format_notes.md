## Texas State Testing File Format Documents
Link to Texas State Testing File Formats: https://tea.texas.gov/student.assessment/datafileformats/

The most relevant files are the "2018 STAAR Grades 3-8 Reporting Data File Format" and the "2018 STAAR End-of-Course Reporting Student Data File Format." These are the file formats for the grades 3-8 exams and the high school exams respectively. 



## Changes from year to year
Conveniently, each Texas file format guide has a section that lists any changes made since the previous year. There are no more than 8-10 changes per year. The changes, for the most part, are additions of columns or deletions of columns from year to year (like deletion of an ELL progress monitor column or addition of a "New to Texas" column). The most significant changes for the past 3 years are that they have moved the "alternate" special ed version of the test to a separate file and they have changed how they labeled meeting a "level II" standard.
