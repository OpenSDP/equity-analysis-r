# Analyzing Equity in Texas Student Outcomes
This repository contains web guides, R code, and sample data to help district
education data analysts explore gaps in student achievement, specifically along
lines of race, socioeconomic status, gender, English language learner status,
special education status, and migrancy status, among others. The guide utilizes
mock data from Texas's standardized exams (STAAR test, grades 3-8). Therefore,
Texas districts can use this code to directly analyze the testing data files
they have received from the Texas Education Agency. However, the code can be
adapted to any other state or district context in which student testing outcomes
are analyzed. This material can also be accessed on the OpenSDP website at
[opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is based on code from the "Analyze" section of the
[Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use).

This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `code` contains the R code of the analysis (and renders the guide)
- `R` contains R functions necessary to complete the analysis
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `img` contains images to format the guides
- `docs` contains style assets to format the guides
- `man` contains the manuals and descriptive files of the data

These materials were originally authored by Dashiell Young-Saver, Jared Knowles,
and the Strategic Data Project team.

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic
code, tools, and training intended to foster collaboration among education
analysts and researchers in order to accelerate the improvement of our school
systems. The community is hosted by the 
[Strategic Data Project](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu), an initiative of the 
[Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University](https://cepr.harvard.edu). 
We welcome contributions and feedback.
